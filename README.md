## Introduction
[DeepDetect](https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect) is an open source Deep Learning Server & API for Caffe, Tensorflow, XGBoost and TSNE. It's very powerful and help us to build new DL & ML models or use them out of the box, but DeepDetect has a lack of support for simple python API usage.       

## Installation

ddcalls was tested on Python3.5+.
